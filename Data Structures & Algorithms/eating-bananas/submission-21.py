#Given a list of piles, we need to find the minimum amount of hours it takes to turn each pile to zero
#Where we can eat k piles at a time, meaning that piles[i] // k (rate at which each banana is eaten)
#Is the amount of hours it takes to eat the bananas
#We can use binary search to find the optimal amount of bananas to eat that will return us the minimum amount of hours
#The number of hours is always greater than the length of piles, meaning that
