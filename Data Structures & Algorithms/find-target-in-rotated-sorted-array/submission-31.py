#With a rotated sorted array, we need to find a value at O(logn) time
#A rotated sorted array is rotated 1..n times, where the amount of rotations rotate
#The final value to the beginning of the array

#To find a value in log n time, we must use binary search
#To identify whether we are getting closer to target or not, we need to find the left sorted partition of 
#The rotated array, comparing the ends of the partition to target to see if we need to search the left sorted partition
#Or the right unsorted partition
