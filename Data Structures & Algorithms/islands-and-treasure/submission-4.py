#Given an mxn 2d grid with possible values -1 (intraversable), 0 (treasure chest), INF - land
#Fill each land cell with the distance to its nearest treasure chest. If a land cell cannot reach a treasure chest, the its value
#Should be INF

        #We'd have to account for that when starting from land.
