#We're given an array of length n that was originally sorted
#It has now been rotated 1..n times, where n rotations mean i values from the end of the array 
#Were moved to the start of the array
#With this, we need to find the minimum value in the array, in log n time

#Log n time already tells us we need to use binary search, but how do we figure out where the traverse?
#Since the array is no longer sorted left to right
#Since the array was sorted and rotated, that gives us the garruntee that there are partitions of the array
#that are sorted in ascending order, and the mininum is always going to be in the right sorted portion granted
#That the array was not rotated n times back into its original form
